Vector AI is a blockchain-connected GPT-style bot designed for advanced DeFi automation and intelligence. It bridges on-chain data, off-chain APIs, and GPT-powered reasoning to deliver real-time analytics, transaction capabilities, and automation directly through Telegram or web chat.

## Core Features:

AI assistant with blockchain connectivity

* Whale tracking, sniper detection, contract analysis
* Telegram-based tipping, bounties, and chat summaries
* Staking and token-gated access to premium tools
* Developer-friendly API integrations for custom logic flows



## How It Works

Here's the process flow:

1.  **User Input (Blockchain Execution)** - Commands via web or Telegram, Vector determines type of request (transaction or request) and process the type of request.\

2. **User Input (Non-Blockchain Interaction)** - Commands via web or Telegram are received. Vector identifies the request type, whether it's a transaction or information request, and processes it accordingly.
