# 💬 Example Queries Enhancement Log

**Date**: January 2025  
**Objective**: Add comprehensive first queries and organize them by categories  
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**

---

## 🎯 **User Request**

> "To the vector GPT interface, add more First Queries and separate them correctly. For example show Analysis queries (such as analyze this transaction) or show Blockchain interaction queries such as 'Send 0.01 ETH to vitalik.eth', 'swap 0.01 ETH for USDC', 'Bridge 0.01 ETH to BASE', 'Deploy ERC20 Token with the Name Test'. Basically give a bunch of types of queries that can be used."
