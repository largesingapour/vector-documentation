# üí° Vector Use Cases

### Use-Cases for Vector

Vector AI/GPT is a blockchain- and web3-focused AI assistant built for real-time, developer-grade interactions that go far beyond static documentation. Here‚Äôs how Vector is uniquely suited to power your web3 and blockchain workflows:

***

#### 1. Smart Contract Analysis & Inspection

* **Function Mapping:** Instantly retrieve a contract‚Äôs functions, view/read distinctions, and discover ABIs for any deployed smart contract.
* **Token & NFT Discovery:** Differentiate between ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155, and bespoke contracts with structure, metadata, and type analysis.
* **Source Code Overview:** Fetch implementation details and contract verification status for transparent auditing.
* **Usage Suggestions:** Vector can recommend interaction patterns based on contract capabilities (e.g., which functions are safe to call, when to require approval, etc.).

#### 2. Wallet & Portfolio Management

* **Comprehensive Balances:** Query token (ERC20, native, etc.) and NFT holdings across any Ethereum-compatible address in real time.
* **Asset Inventory:** Review all assets owned by a specific wallet, check for ‚Äúdust‚Äù/small balances, and gather details per asset type.
* **NFT Ownership:** Enumerate NFTs owned, collection affiliations, and metadata for each, facilitating portfolio analysis or transfer readiness.

#### 3. Transaction & Event Exploration

* **Activity Tracing:** List transactions (incoming/outgoing), high-value transfers, recent activity by value/time, and block inclusion.
* **Event Log Analysis:** Decode and filter logs by type/signature, view on-chain events by contract/address, and find usage spikes or anomalies.
* **Live Monitoring:** Find the latest transactions, high-value movements, and link these to wallet or contract insights.

#### 4. Token & NFT Operations ‚Äì Without Leaving the Assistant

* **Token Transfers:** Prepare, simulate, and execute transfers for ETH, ERC20, ERC721, and ERC1155 based assets.
* **Minting/Burning:** Kick off new token mints (both single and batch), or burn (destroy) tokens straight from the chat.
* **Approval Management:** Safely set or revoke spending approvals for DEXes, contracts, or other wallets with granular control.
* **NFT Management:** Transfer or mint NFTs to/from specific wallets using in-protocol workflows, ideal for testing and development.

#### 5. Tokenomics, Swaps, and Cross-Chain Operations

* **Price & Supply Checks:** Instantly pull current price or circulating supply data for major and custom tokens.
* **Swapping & Bridging:** Prepare swaps (ETH/USDC or any supported token) or cross-chain bridges directly, with real-time route and rate insight.
* **Native<>Wrapped Conversions:** Wrap/unwrap ETH, MATIC, etc. as needed for protocol compatibility or DeFi usage.

#### 6. Deployment & Project Bootstrapping

* **Deploy New Contracts:** Use vector standardized templates to deploy ERC20, ERC721, or ERC1155 contracts.
* **Sequential Operations:** Mint, transfer, or configure tokens/NFTs right after deployment, including handling of new (pending) contract addresses.
* **SDK Guidance:** Get up-to-date, actionable code snippets and integration patterns (always sourced from latest docs).

#### 7. Real-Time Chain and Block Data

* **Block Inspection:** Fetch the latest or specific block‚Äôs content: transactions, miner, gas usage, etc.
* **Network Metadata:** Retrieve chain identifiers, gas prices, and basic info for supported chains.

#### 8. Security & Verification

* **EOA vs Contract Detection:** Instantly check whether an address is a contract or a wallet.
* **Verification Status:** Validate source code verification, proxy status, and interface compliance of deployed contracts.
* **Audit Helper:** Spot potentially risky functions or interfaces before interacting.

#### 9. Web3 Development Q\&A

* **Blockchain First SDK expert:** Always cite the latest, official SDK/contract documentation for implementation guidance.
* **Troubleshooting:** Diagnose integration issues by inspecting real contract state and example transactions.
