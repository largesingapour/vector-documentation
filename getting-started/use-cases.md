# VGPT Use Cases

Vector AI offers advanced tooling for evaluating token legitimacy, automating due diligence, and surfacing on-chain intelligence through natural language and AI reasoning via VGPT.&#x20;

***

#### 🧠 Multi-Pipeline Token Scanning

Automatically evaluate the credibility of new tokens by scanning Twitter, Telegram, and other off-chain platforms as well as token security, holder information and honeypot checks.\

***

#### Ask VGPT About a Scan

Want deeper insights?\
Once a token is scanned, you can **ask VGPT follow-up questions** like:

* "Is this team linked to any past scams?"
* "Summarize the project based on their docs and site."
* "Does the Twitter match the contract?"
* "What’s suspicious about this token?"
* "Rate this project’s legitimacy from 1–10."

🧠 **VGPT connects the dots** across contract code, websites, socials, and documentation — giving you human-like reasoning in seconds.

#### 🔗 Deep Link Ecosystem Analysis

Extract and verify all links from token websites, documentation, and social profiles.\
Detect inconsistencies, reused templates, and mismatched identities that signal scams or impersonators.\
\
VGPT cross-references team bios, project claims, and social engagement to flag red flags or verify authenticity.

#### 🧬 Cross-Signal Token Scoring

Assign scores to tokens using:

* On-chain metrics
* Off-chain APIs
* WHOIS domain records
* Website content
* Social signals\

***

#### 📄 Documentation & Site Intelligence

Scrape and summarize:

* Project websites
* GitBooks
* Technical documentation

Determine originality, effort, and consistency across platforms to help identify low-effort forks and clones.

***

#### 🔁 Automated Contract Matching

Match smart contracts to all linked project assets.\
Verify if contracts are mentioned on official sites, socials, and vice versa — identifying fake or unlinked tokens.\
